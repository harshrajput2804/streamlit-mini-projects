This platform is developed using Python and Streamlit and serves as a centralized hub for multiple interactive mini web applications. Each mini app is designed to solve real-world problems, demonstrate data visualization, and provide user-friendly tools for analysis and exploration.

Inside this application, you will find a variety of projects such as dashboards, data-driven tools, and smart utilities that highlight my skills in Python programming, data handling, and modern web app development. The goal of this project is to learn by building, experiment with new ideas, and create practical applications that are simple, fast, and interactive.

Feel free to explore the mini apps, interact with the features, and experience how powerful Python and Streamlit can be when combined for rapid web development.""")
